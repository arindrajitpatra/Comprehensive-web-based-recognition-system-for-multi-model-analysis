# Comprehensive-web-based-recognition-system-for-multi-model-analysis
This project aims to develop a comprehensive computer vision system capable of detecting objects, text, and their respective colours from a live video feed captured by a webcam. Additionally, the system integrates audio detection and transcription functionalities, enabling the conversion of any audio present in the video into plain text. The proposed solution leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to accurately identify objects and text in real-time, while also determining the associated colours of text and objects detected by webcam. The deployment of this system as a web application is facilitated by the integration of JavaScript and Flask, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system seamlessly. By combining advanced image processing with audio analysis, this project addresses the need for a versatile tool capable of extracting meaningful information from multimedia content in various scenarios.
